    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage."

    "## File Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- train.csv: Contains 172 columns. The primary key that represents each customer is id. The target variable that you need to predict is churn_probability which contains a value of 0 or 1. This data is what you are going to use for EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, model evaluation, model selection, and finally model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- test.csv: Contains 171 columns, doesn't contain the target variable churn_probability. You will apply all the necessary preprocessing steps to get this data into the right format and then use the model trained using the train.csv file to make predictions with this. This is unseen data! Only the competition hosts know the actual values of the target feature for this data and therefore your submissions will be evaluated on how well your model does with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- sample.csv: This contains the format in which you need to submit the solutions to Kaggle. The id column in this dataset exactly the same as the id column in test.csv. You will make your predictions on the test.csv data and store them in a submission file that has the same format as this file. Check the Overview>Evaluation tab for mode details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- data_dictionary.csv: This contains the definitions for the various acronyms that you will need to understand each variable. For example, the variable total_og_mou_7, contains the acronyms total, og, mou, and 7, which can be translated as the total outgoing minutes of voice calls made by the user in month of July."
